### Allows us to upload a file
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()

### We pass the read file into a dataframe
import pandas as pd
import io

df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(uploaded['AAPL10Y.csv'].decode('utf-8')), sep = ',')

### If it is inside the directory:
df = pd.read_csv('gs://cloud-training/ai4f/AAPL10Y.csv')
